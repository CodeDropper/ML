We pre booked a room with a meal plan described as “bed and breakfast”. Two things happened that spoilt things. 1. We arrived quite late but had emailed twice prior to our departure to let the hotel know. No response & when we arrived we were lucky to meet a family who also arrived late but had a code for a safe box outside the hotel where we could get room keys. We never got sent a code but our keys were in the box. Phew! 2. We ate breakfast as per meal plan we paid for but on check out were charged 10euros each for breakfast (additional 30euros on bill) when I pointed out the meal plan we were told it meant breakfast was

But the room and facilities were of a very poor quality. The double bed was more like a king single and designed for short people only. This is due to the size of the room being so small that a proper sized double bed would not fit. The room was noisy all night, there was a washing machine running for most of the night and you could hear noises coming from all directions during the night.

Hotel is more than reasonable for the price and the hotel is full of young people I would not recommend for families or people looking for a “relaxing” break.   The noise in the hotel is 24hr it never stops people on their balcony’s all hours as well as around the pool getting wrecked no matter where you go there is music being played by other guests.   Went self-catering so I can’t comment on food or drink.   Only downsides security are nasty people if you get on the wrong side of them from what I’ve seen and the hotel DOES NOT HAVE AIR CON! Meaning the rooms don’t cool down at all it was actually cooler on the balcony than the room.

We promptly refused and tried to reason with them with no avail. So then, they threatened to call the Police. We heartily welcomed the idea. After a few minutes, Police arrived, and after hearing the full story, the Police immediately sided with us! We left them with the bill still on their counter.   They coerced, threatened and forced many senior holidaymakers to pay them money with bogus claims. It was tough to see how they treat their loyal customers of many years.

Europe,Germany,Bavaria,Apartmenthaus B34,,,,3.0,"Our host was excellent, he was in touch with us a number of times prior to our arrival. We booked the apartment as our schedule had us in Erlangen for four nights at the end of our European holiday. The apartment was spacious, and renovated on a budget, clean and tidy and otherwise appealing, however the primary function of the accommodation is to get a good nights sleep and that wasn't going to happen. The bed was substandard in that it was saggy and lacked support. There was a street light also directly outside our window and the curtains did little to block the light. If you're driving, parking is rare in this inner city location. Our host was going to arrange a parking permit, however we checked out after the first night. These things could easily be addressed by the host,"

It is also MUCH more peaceful than the nearby Port of Pollença and Alcudia. The hotel is small and was relatively quiet - both great assets in our view. Other assets were the terraced bar, with excellent beer, and the restaurant. For some reason the restaurant was extremely quiet in the evenings, where a daily menu was available with three courses with a choice from two starters, two mains and a dessert, and a drink - for 23 Euros per person. Every dinner we had was excellent and home cooked, and it was surprising to us why it wasn’t more popular. The breakfasts, which were included"

Un acierto total. Un pequeño apartamento acogedor, perfectamente decorado con unas vistas increíbles. La familia que lo regenta es muy amable.  No os dejéis engañar por la palabra pensión puesto que nada tiene que ver con lo que estamos acostumbrados a ver cómo pensión en España. Es un landhaus, que es como una casa rural, llena de apartamentos y que tienen algunas cosas en común: este tiene piscina climatizada con unas vistas fantásticas (además tienes una maquina centrífuga que seca los bañadores), Ping pong, futbolín, y máquinas de gimnasio.  También debo indicar que nos pusieron cuna sin cargo alguno. El precio está realmente genial.. Nosotros"

The rooms - the fourth floor, especially - are beautifully done - and the views over the valley are to die for. However, the real joy is the welcome. The locals in the Forest are generally pretty easy-going and pleasant, but the Sommerberg are a step up from even that high standard. The dog is cute, too, even if there is a risk of falling over him in the lobby. Highly recommend "

I am here with my husband, son, daughter and her partner staying on an all inclusive basis. We are staying in room 515 (superior) the rooms are very nice, clean and comfortable.  Maids come and clean every day.  Could do with more towels though. The hotel has recently had to change how you can order your drinks due to the covid and restrictions so you now have to sit outside the pool bar and wait for service instead of going to the bar yourself, this has proven difficult as it takes longer to get served this way, but the staff work incredibly"

Stayed 6 nights this year, booked direct on their website and arrived to find a bottle of wine in our room. Like other reviews we returned because the service by Pablo and his family is so friendly and welcoming. Very clean rooms, a superb breakfast tray for 2 is served at your table (see my previous review), excellent location, peaceful and idyllic. The garden areas are a pleasure to see. Free parking for guests is a bonus! Located very close to the heart of Port d’Andratx. This is an established “authentic” traditional family run bed and breakfast so the facilities reflect this. There are ground floor and first floor rooms all accessed externally. Excellent value for money. Open March to end of October."

We went for an organised walk through the vineyards to look at the black vultures.  There’s a rocky track up to the hotel from the main road that’s fine in a small car and if you take your time and go slowly.  The decor of the hotel is traditional, very tasteful and clean.  Breakfast is good with a typical choice of fruit, ham, cheese, cereals, bread and eggs cooked to order.  Evening meals are also excellent. We had the shoulder of lamb, tumbet, and baked bacalao.
